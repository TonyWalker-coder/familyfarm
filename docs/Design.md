# Design System — Foundations

These foundations define the core principles, styles, and assets that shape the visual and functional identity of the project. They ensure consistency, accessibility, and a shared language across design and development.

## About This Documentation

This design system and README follow common industry expectations for project documentation. A good README explains what the project is, how to use it, and how it’s structured. A design document goes further by outlining the decisions behind the work — accessibility standards, typography, colour choices, assets, and usage guidelines. This level of documentation supports maintainability, transparency, and assessment criteria such as Merit+, where clear justification and traceability of design decisions are required.

## Accessibility Standards

This project follows **WCAG 2.2 Level AA,** the standard recommended by **GOV.UK** and required for legal compliance in the UK. **WCAG** ensures content is:

- Perceivable
- Operable
- Understandable
- Robust

## Typography

Fonts sourced from [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)  
These fonts were chosen to balance warmth, readability, and brand personality.

### Headings — Bree Serif

Friendly, handcrafted, and distinctive without compromising clarity.

### Body Text — Nunito

Modern, clean, and highly readable across devices and sizes.

## Colour Palette

The colour palette was chosen based on the images being used on the site to ensure a level of contrast on the pages.

### Brand Colours (Shared Across Themes)

--brand-barn-red: #5A0F0F;
--brand-sun-gold: #E8C9A1;
--brand-grass-green: #C7D7A4;
--brand-sky-blue: #D8E4F0;
--brand-earth-brown: #3A2A1E;

### Light Theme

--light-bg: #F9F3E6;  
--light-surface: #F4E9D2;  
--light-text: #3A2A1E;  
--light-heading: #5A0F0F;  
--light-border: #E8C9A1;  
--light-accent: #C7D7A4;  
--light-accent-hover: #AFC48B;  

### Dark Theme

--dark-bg: #1F2E1A;  
--dark-surface: #2D3F52;  
--dark-text: #F4E9D2;  
--dark-heading: #E8C9A1;  
--dark-border: #3A2A1E;  
--dark-accent: #C7D7A4;  
--dark-accent-hover: #D8E4F0;  

### Semantic Tokens

Semantic tokens represent meaning (e.g., “heading colour”) rather than specific theme values. They allow the design system to scale and adapt across light and dark themes.

--color-heading → light: --light-heading / dark: --dark-heading  
--color-text → light: --light-text / dark: --dark-text  
--color-accent → light: --light-accent / dark: --dark-accent  
--color-border → light: --light-border / dark: --dark-border  
--color-surface → light: --light-surface / dark: --dark-surface  

## Design Notes

The idea behind this colour palette

- Barn red + sun gold = recognisable brand signature
- Grass green works in both themes without contrast issues
- You’ve avoided the classic dark‑mode low‑contrast trap
- Palette is strong enough to support seasonal variants (your idea — and a good one)

## Logo Attribution

The project logo was generated by Microsoft Copilot based solely on a written description provided by the user. No external images, trademarks, or copyrighted materials were used during its creation. Any resemblance to existing logos or brand identities is unintentional and purely coincidental.


## Wireframes

Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](Balsamiq.com)

Why Balsamiq

- Quick to iterate
- Fast‑iteration no nonsense approach
- Forces clarity of layout
- Minimal amount of experience required to create a working model

These wireframes form the backbone of the layout decisions in this system.

## Image Licensing

All images used in this project are sourced from copyright‑free or permissively licensed libraries. This ensures:

- No copyright risk
- Freedom to modify and optimise

## Usage Guidelines

These guidelines ensure consistent, accessible, and intentional use of images, typography, and colour across the project.

## Image Usage Guidelines

Images support the brand’s warmth and storytelling, but they must remain accessible and purposeful.

### Alt Text

- Every meaningful image must include descriptive alt text
- Keep it short, factual, and focused on what the user needs to know
- Decorative images should use empty alt text (alt="")

### Aspect Ratios

- Use consistent aspect ratios across similar components (e.g., cards, hero banners)
- Recommended:
- 16:9 for wide banners
- 4:3 or 1:1 for cards and thumbnails

### Cropping

- Crop for clarity
- Keep the subject centred or aligned to a clear focal point
- Avoid cutting off key details (faces, objects, signage)

### Quality & Style

- Use high‑resolution images that remain crisp on retina displays
- Avoid overly stylised filters or low‑contrast photography
- Prefer natural lighting and authentic textures to match the farm’s brand

### Performance

- Optimise images for web (compression, modern formats where possible)
- Use responsive image sizes to avoid loading unnecessary large files

## Typography Usage Guidelines

### Font Pairing

- Bree Serif → headings only
- Nunito → body text, UI text, labels, buttons

### Line Height

- Body text: 1.5–1.7
- Headings: 1.2–1.3

### Max Line Length

- Aim for 60–75 characters per line
- Prevents “wall of text” fatigue
- Improves scanning and comprehension

### Heading Scale

- H1: 2.25rem
- H2: 1.75rem
- H3: 1.5rem
- H4: 1.25rem
- H5: 1.125rem
- H6: 1rem

### Hierarchy Rules

- Use one H1 per page
- Don’t skip heading levels
- Keep headings short and meaningful

### Readability

- Avoid justified text
- Use sentence case for headings (friendly, modern, accessible)
- Ensure strong colour contrast (WCAG AA minimum)

## Colour Usage Guidelines

### Accents

- Use grass green as the primary accent for buttons, links, and highlights
- Use accents sparingly to maintain impact
- Hover states must meet contrast requirements

### Surfaces

- Use light-surface or dark-surface for cards, panels, and UI blocks
- Avoid mixing too many surface colours on one page
- Maintain clear separation between background and surface layers

### Borders

- Use borders subtly to define structure
- Light theme → warm gold border
- Dark theme → earthy brown border
- Avoid heavy or high‑contrast borders unless needed for accessibility

### Headings & Text

- Headings use brand colours (barn red in light mode, sun gold in dark mode)
- Body text must always meet WCAG AA contrast
- Never use accent colours for long‑form text
